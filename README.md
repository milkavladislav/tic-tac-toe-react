# About repo

In this repo I created a simple Tic-tac-toe in which I used technologies such as React, Typescript.

## Deploy

Game was deploy on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).\
See site [here](https://to-do-l1st-redux-react.netlify.app/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
